# Particle Sim

There is neat Vector formula for computing particle velocities after an elastic collision. It's on this [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision#Two-dimensional_collision_with_two_moving_objects).

This Raylib sketch attempts to model a Gas as a collection of fast moving particles that only interact via elastic collisions.

## Roadmap

- [ ] 2 particles with collisions between each other and boundary
- [ ] Multiple (> 2) particles 
  - [ ] Implement a fixed-sized arena to hold particles
- [ ] Quadtrees 
- [ ] Compare with Physics
